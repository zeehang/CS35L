Laboratory Notes

1. I used the command git clone git://git.savanna.gnu.org/diffutils.git in order to clone the git directory on to my local machine.
2. I used cd to get into the newly created diffutils directory and used git log > git-log.txt to create a text file showing changes
3. Used git tag > git-tags.txt to create a file with the tags used in the git respository
4. I used the search function in emacs to find the string that matched that commit in git-log.txt.
Making note of the commit number, I used the command git format-patch -1 <COMMIT NUMBER> to create a patch, then renamed it.
5. To check out version 3.0, I used the commmand git checkout v3.0 (seeing as v3.0 was a tag in the git repository)
6. Using the command patch -p1 < quote-patch,txt, I was able to patch the file. There were 3 patches where the file couldn't be found, HACKING, diffutils.texi and man/help2man
The following parts failed
patching file src/diff.c
Hunk #10 FAILED at 876.
Hunk #11 FAILED at 906.
Hunk #12 FAILED at 942.
patching file src/diff3.c
Hunk #6 FAILED at 433.
7. According to git status the following files were modified.
	modified:   NEWS
	modified:   README
	modified:   TODO
	modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
	modified:   ms/config.bat
	modified:   ms/config.site
	modified:   po/en.po
	modified:   src/analyze.c
	modified:   src/cmp.c
	modified:   src/context.c
	modified:   src/diff.c
	modified:   src/diff.h
	modified:   src/diff3.c
	modified:   src/dir.c
	modified:   src/ifdef.c
	modified:   src/io.c
	modified:   src/sdiff.c
	modified:   src/side.c
	modified:   src/system.h
	modified:   src/util.c
	modified:   tests/help-version
9. According to the above list, I used emacs to open each file and used C-x v u to remove the changes to files that were not .c. These files were
NEWS
README
TODO
doc/diagmeet.note
ms/config.bat
ms/config.site
po/en.po
src/diff.h
src/system.h
tests/help-version

10. I manually applied rejected changes from diff3.c.rej and diff.c.rej

Additionally, I reverted the changes to comments using C-c C-a
11. I used git clean -f to remove untracked files.
12. git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
13. ran ./bootstrap
applied the patch available at the website
./configure
make
make check

ran ./diff --help and ./diff . - to make sure that it works

14. I renamed the directory and made a new directory with
git clone, then git checkout v3.0 and ran the command given
in the spec.

15. The two versions are not identical, but the differences are innnocuous,
they simply feature the difference in quotation marks.
