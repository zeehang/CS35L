The time for sfrob was

real	0m0.617s
user	0m0.341s
sys	0m0.090s

The time for sfrobu was

real	0m1.976s
user	0m0.346s
sys	0m1.618s

Like before, this makes sense. System calls will be slower so sfrobu should
take more time. Like before

Running with a 1 line file - 39 comparisons
10 line file - 712
100 line file - 11197

This gives us an approximately linear trend comparison between the number
of the lines in the file and the number of comparisons made, which
makes sense.
