In order to test the timing of sfrob, sfrobu and sfrobs, I created a file
which contained copies of the test string provided in Assignment 5. The
timings are shown as followed.

The time for sfrob was

real	0m0.040s
user	0m0.028s
sys	0m0.010s

The time for sfrobu was

real	0m0.285s
user	0m0.040s
sys	0m0.243s

The time for sfrobs was

real	0m0.049s
user	0m0.043s
sys	0m0.011s

Like before, this makes sense. System calls will be slower so sfrobu should
take more time than any of the others. Sfrob and sfrobs were pretty similar
in time. They both depend on relatively optimized functions, so this makes
sense.

Running with a 1 line file - 39 comparisons
10 line file - 712
100 line file - 11197

This gives us an approximately linear trend comparison between the number
of the lines in the file and the number of comparisons made, which
makes sense.
