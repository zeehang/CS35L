Labatory Notebook

1. Using the command
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

I downloaded the file into my local directory
and the ran ./configure and make
Upon running the make command, the error message stated that
the futimens function had conflicting types.
The files affected were utimecap.c, utimecap.h

2. Used the command
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

To grab the patch from the website then used the command
patch -p0 < coreutils.diff to apply the patch

patching file lib/utimens.c
patching file lib/utimens.h
patching file src/copy.c
patching file src/tee.c
patching file src/touch.c

The patch renames the function such that they will no longer conflict with each other.

3. Used ./configure and make, which worked succesfully with the patch applied

4. Ran the commands available on the webpage to reproduce the issue and
the older touch file was placed first in the output, which was incorrect.

5. To find the source of the issue, I started by looking through the source code of ls.c. Based off intutition, it is fair to assume that there is some
issue with a sorting algorithm within the function. One function that did so
was cmp_mtime which called timespec_cmp. That function simply finds the difference
between the two times that are passed in, which can lead to problems of overflow
and wraparound if one term is too large. Therefore, we can simply use the
greater than and less than comparators to look at dates.

Generated the patch with diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespecfix.h

And used C-x 4 a to add a changelog.

There is an issue when running it on the SEASnet server, where the timestamp
appears in the future and incorrectly. Because the SEASnet is unsigned,
and a local is signed, the value will not account for that sign potential
thus presenting a much higher value. Therefore, we must touch the file on the local system.
