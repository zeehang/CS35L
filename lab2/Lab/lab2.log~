tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' - for any character that are the complement of the first set (so any character that is not an upper or lower case letter), that letter will be replaced by a newline

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' - if there are multiple new lines in a row, they are compressed to one single newline. So now, all words have their own line in the file.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort - same as the output in the previous answer, except that the lines are now sorted alphabetically

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u - sorts the file as seen in the previous answer, but removes all duplicates of words, makes sure that each line printed is unique

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words - takes the output as seen in the previous anwer and compares it to a dictionary of words. The output for this command is in three columns, the first containing words that are unique to the HTML file, the second containing words unique to the dictionary and the third containing words that appear in both

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 words - only displays the first column of the previous answer. This means that the output consists of files in the HTMl file that are not in the dictionary

buildwords script
The run down of the script goes like this. The script first uses the tr command to turn everything into lowercase. Then, using multiple sed commands, I remove the underlining HTML tags as well as the isolate the page to just the table. I recognized that the English words were always inbetween a <tr> and a </td> tag, so I used the sed command to remove those tags (in that order) and anything in between them. Following that, I removed the remaining HTML tags as well as any extraneous spaces, used the sort -u command to remove extra line breaks and any duplicate entries. Finally, I removed any lines that contained non-Hawaiian characters using the sed command.

Spellchecker
To check for english words, you can use this command:
cat assign2.html | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words

Using the word count command, it was found that there were 38 'mispelled' English words on the page

To check for mispelled Hawaiian words, simply replace words with hwords in the previous command. There are 408 mispelled Hawaiian words on the page.

An example of a word that was mispelled in English but correct in Hawaiian is 'wiki'. There are a lot more that are mispelled in Hawaiian but correct in English, such as the word 'change'.

Sameln log
My sameln script works as follows.
I first look through the directory for hidden files, storing those in one variable.
Then, I look for all non hidden files, storing those in another variable.
I then take the hidden files and put them in the array (sorted in alphabetical order),
and then use the same process to put in the regular files, *after* the hidden files in the array.
When adding these to the array, I use the -f option in the if statment to make sure that it
