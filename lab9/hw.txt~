Homework notes

1. Because we were sending data using ssh, it would be safe. Although they
would be able to see the public key, the data can only be encrypted
by the RECEIVERS private key - which never gets transferred. The initial
"handhsake" session key would be extremely hard to decrypt, thus the data
should be secure.

However - if they had access to the keyboard, then they would be able to guess
the passphrase based on keyboard input. That means they'd be able to
decrypt the key and access the information.

As with a lot of things in security, physical control by a hacker (even
temporarily) will probably make it unsafe. If they had control of the system
they could find the public and private keys that were saved in the home
directory. Then, they'd be able to decrypt the information sent between
the two computers.

2. gpg --verify only verifies the cleartext signature, it does not infect
verify the identity of who is sending the information. For example, you
could spoof data by intercepting communication then replacing it with your
own false data. If the "middle man" was to encrypt the data using their own
key, verify will still work, since its simply ensuring that a document
has not been altered since the signature was created - it doesn't account
for the fact that there could be a completely new and spoofed document (whose
signature would still verify!)
