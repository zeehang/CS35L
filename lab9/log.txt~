Lab Log

First I generated my public and private keys using the command
ssh-keygen

I saved the filese in the default locations and gave myself
the passphrase 'november'.

Acting as the client

After my partner installed the server, I used the command
ssh-copy-id -i jamin@10.97.85.136
and was able to successfully copy my key to his server after logging
in using the password that we created.
Using the command
ssh -add
I added the private key to the ssh-agent and was prompted to
input the passphrase that I had created earlier.
Following these steps, I was able to log in to the server
without a password/passphrase by simply typing
ssh jamin@10.97.85.136

I was able to create files and run commands, and by using the
-x modifier (ssh -X) I was able to run/see GUI programs on the
client side.

Acting as the server

After ensuring the the open-ssh server software package was installed,
I added a new user to the system by using the command
sudo useradd -d /home/newuser1 -m user1

and create a password 'user1' for the account using
sudo password user1

After this I used
cd /home/newuser1
to go into the directory and create a .ssh directory for user1 by using
sudo mkdir .ssh

Following the creation of the directory, I changed the ownersship
and permissions so that they'd be accessible to the new user:
chmod chown -R user1 .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

They were then able to log in and perform commands using their
client side computers.
