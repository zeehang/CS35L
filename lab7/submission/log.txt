1. First, I checked that the version of coreutils was up to date, by
using the command sort --version.

2. To create the file of randomly generated floating point numbers,
I used the command

od -An -f -N 80000000 /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > randomtext

which placed 10,000,000 floating point numbers in the file 'randomtext'.

3. The commands for each round of sorting and their subsequent results are
listed below

time -p sort -g --parallel=1 randomtext > /dev/null
real 218.50
user 218.03
sys 0.45

time -p sort -g --parallel=2 randomtext > /dev/null
real 113.80
user 217.06
sys 0.66

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 randomtext > /dev/null
real 68.35
user 233.77
sys 0.78

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 randomtext > /dev/null
real 43.20
user 234.25
sys 1.02

while user time does remain relatively constant, we can see that the 'real'
time used to execute the command decreases with each additional core.
